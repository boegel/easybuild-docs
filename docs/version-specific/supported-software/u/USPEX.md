# USPEX

USPEX (Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallography...  and in Russian "uspekh" means "success" - owing to the high success rate and many  useful results produced by this method) is a method developed by the Oganov  laboratory since 2004. The problem of crystal structure prediction is very old and  does, in fact, constitute the central problem of theoretical crystal chemistry.  USPEX can also be used for finding low-energy metastable phases, as well as stable  structures of nanoparticles, surface reconstructions, molecular packings in organic  crystals, and for searching for materials with desired physical (mechanical,  electronic) properties. The USPEX code is based on an efficient evolutionary  algorithm developed by A.R. Oganov's group, but also has options for using  alternative methods (random sampling, metadynamics, corrected particle swarm  optimization algorithms). USPEX is interfaced with many ab initio codes, such as  VASP, SIESTA, GULP, Quantum Espresso, CP2K, CASTEP, LAMMPS, and so on.
