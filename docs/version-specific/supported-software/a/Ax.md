# Ax

Ax is an accessible, general-purpose platform for understanding, managing, deploying, and  automating adaptive experiments. Adaptive experimentation is the machine-learning guided process of iteratively exploring  a (possibly infinite) parameter space in order to identify optimal configurations in a  resource-efficient manner. Ax currently supports Bayesian optimization and bandit  optimization as exploration strategies. Bayesian optimization in Ax is powered by  BoTorch, a modern library for Bayesian optimization research built on PyTorch.
