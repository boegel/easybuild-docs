# ALAMODE

ALAMODE is an open source software designed for analyzing lattice anharmonicity  and lattice thermal conductivity of solids. By using an external DFT package such as VASP and  Quantum ESPRESSO, you can extract harmonic and anharmonic force constants straightforwardly with ALAMODE.  Using the calculated anharmonic force constants, you can also estimate lattice thermal conductivity,  phonon linewidth, and other anharmonic phonon properties from first principles.
