# ALADIN

ALADIN was entirely built on the notion of compatibility with its mother system, IFS/ARPEG.  The latter, a joint development between the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and  Meteo-France, was only meant to consider global Numerical Weather Prediction applications; hence the idea,  for ALADIN, to complement the IFS/ARPEGE project with a limited area model (LAM) version, while keeping the  differences between the two softwares as small as possible.
