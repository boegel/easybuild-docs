# AutoDock-GPU

OpenCL and Cuda accelerated version of AutoDock. It leverages its embarrasingly parallelizable LGA by processing ligand-receptor poses in parallel over multiple compute units. AutoDock is a suite of automated docking tools. It is designed to predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure.
