# ALFA

ALFA provides a global overview of features distribution composing NGS dataset(s). Given a set of  aligned reads (BAM files) and an annotation file (GTF format), the tool produces plots of the raw and normalized  distributions of those reads among genomic categories (stop codon, 5'-UTR, CDS, intergenic, etc.) and biotypes  (protein coding genes, miRNA, tRNA, etc.). Whatever the sequencing technique, whatever the organism.
