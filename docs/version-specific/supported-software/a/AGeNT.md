# AGeNT

The Agilent Genomics NextGen Toolkit (AGeNT) is a Java-based software module that processes the read sequences from targeted high-throughput sequencing data generated by sequencing Agilent SureSelect and HaloPlex libraries.  The Trimmer utility of the AGeNT module processes the read sequences to identify and remove the adaptor sequences and extracts dual molecular barcodes (for SureSelect XT HS2).  The LocatIt utility of the AGeNT module processes the Molecular Barcode (MBC) information from HaloPlex HS, SureSelect XT HS, and SureSelect XT HS2 Illumina sequencing runs with options to either mark or merge duplicate reads and output in BAM file format. The Illumina InterOp libraries are a set of common routines used for reading InterOp metric files produced by Illumina sequencers including NextSeq 1k/2k. These libraries are backwards compatible and capable of supporting prior releases of the software, with one exception: GA systems have been excluded.
