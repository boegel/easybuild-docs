# CPB

CPB is a novel two-step Pearson correlation based biclustering approach to mine genes that are co-regulated with   a given reference gene in order to discover genes that function in a common biological process.   In the first step, the algorithm identifies subsets of genes with high correlation, reducing false negatives   with a nonparametric filtering scheme.   In the second step, biclusters from multiple datasets are used to extract and rank gene correlation information.
