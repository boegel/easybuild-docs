# cryoDRGN

cryoDRGN: Deep Reconstructing Generative Networks for cryo-EM heterogeneous  reconstruction.  CryoDRGN is a neural network based algorithm for heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. In  particular, the method models a continuous distribution over 3D structures by using a neural  network based representation for the volume.
