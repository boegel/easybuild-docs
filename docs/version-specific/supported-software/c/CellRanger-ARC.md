# CellRanger-ARC

Cell Ranger ARC is a set of analysis pipelines that process  Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression sequencing data to generate a  variety of analyses pertaining to gene expression, chromatin accessibility and  their linkage. Furthermore, since the ATAC and gene expression measurements are on  the very same cell, we are able to perform analyses that link chromatin  accessibility and gene expression.
