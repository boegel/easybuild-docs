# CREST

CREST is an utility/driver program for the xtb program. Originally it was designed  as conformer sampling program, hence the abbreviation Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool,  but now offers also some utility functions for calculations with the GFNn–xTB methods. Generally  the program functions as an IO based OMP scheduler (i.e., calculations are performed by the xtb  program) and tool for the creation and analysation of structure ensembles.
