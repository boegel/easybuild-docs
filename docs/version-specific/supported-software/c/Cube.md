# Cube

Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and  Score-P, is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space  consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and (iii) system  resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree  can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity.
