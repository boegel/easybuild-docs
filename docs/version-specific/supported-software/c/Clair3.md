# Clair3

Clair3 is a germline small variant caller for long-reads. Clair3 makes the best of two major method categories: pileup calling handles most variant candidates with speed, and full-alignment tackles complicated candidates to maximize precision and recall. Clair3 runs fast and has superior performance, especially at lower coverage. Clair3 is simple and modular for easy deployment and integration.
