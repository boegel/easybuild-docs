# CWIPI

CWIPI (Coupling With Interpolation Parallel Interface) library helps in chaining and coupling codes. Provides exchanges of interpolated fields through a non-compliant geometric interface and allows control of the coupling algorithm using control parameters. CWIPI takes advantage of the distribution of the definition of the coupling algorithm in the different codes.
