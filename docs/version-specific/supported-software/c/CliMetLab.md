# CliMetLab

CliMetLab is a Python package aiming at simplifying access to climate and meteorological datasets, allowing users to focus on science instead of technical issues such as data access and data formats. It is mostly intended to be used in Jupyter notebooks, and be interoperable with all popular data analytic packages, such as Numpy, Pandas, Xarray, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc. as well as machine learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow, Keras or PyTorch.
