# ChimPipe

ChimPipe is a computational method for the detection of novel transcription-induced  chimeric transcripts and fusion genes from Illumina Paired-End RNA-seq data. It combines junction  spanning and paired-end read information to accurately detect chimeric splice junctions at base-pair  resolution.
