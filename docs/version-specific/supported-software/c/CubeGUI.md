# CubeGUI

Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P,  is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space  consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and  (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where  non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the  desired level of granularity.   This module provides the Cube graphical report explorer.
