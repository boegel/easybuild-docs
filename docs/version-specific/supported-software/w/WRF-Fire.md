# WRF-Fire

WRF-Fire combines the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) with a fire code implementing a  surface fire behavior model, called SFIRE, based on semi-empirical formulas calculate the rate of spread of the fire  line (the interface between burning and unignited fuel) based on fuel properties, wind velocities from WRF, and  terrain slope. The fire spread is implemented by the level set method.
