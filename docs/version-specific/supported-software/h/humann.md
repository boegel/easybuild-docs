HUMAnN v3 is a pipeline for efficiently  and accurately determining the coverage and abundance  of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data. Sequencing a metagenome typically produces millions  of short DNA/RNA reads. This process, referred  to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential  of a microbial community and its members. More generally,  functional profiling answers the question:  What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?
