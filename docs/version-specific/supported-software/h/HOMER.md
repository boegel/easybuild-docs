# HOMER

HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) is a suite of tools for Motif Discovery and  next-gen sequencing analysis.  It is a collection of command line programs for unix-style operating systems written  in Perl and C++. HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm and is well suited for finding  8-20 bp motifs in large scale genomics data.  HOMER contains many useful tools for analyzing ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq,  RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq, Hi-C and numerous other types of functional genomics sequencing data sets.
