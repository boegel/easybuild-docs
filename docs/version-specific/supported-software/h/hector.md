This is the repository for Hector, an open source, object-oriented,  simple global climate carbon-cycle model. It runs essentially instantaneously while  still representing the most critical global scale earth system processes, and is  one of a class of models heavily used for for emulating complex climate models  and uncertainty analyses.
