# Hybpiper

HybPiper was designed for targeted sequence capture,  in which DNA sequencing libraries are enriched for gene regions of interest,  especially for phylogenetics. HybPiper is a suite of Python scripts/modules  that wrap and connect bioinformatics tools in order to extract target  sequences from high-throughput DNA sequencing reads.
