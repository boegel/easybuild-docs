# HDBSCAN

The hdbscan library is a suite of tools to use unsupervised learning to find clusters, or dense  regions, of a dataset. The primary algorithm is HDBSCAN* as proposed by Campello, Moulavi, and Sander. The library  provides a high performance implementation of this algorithm, along with tools for analysing the resulting  clustering.
