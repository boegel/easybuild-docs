# hiredis

Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.  It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol,  but at the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API in order to  make it much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base  and the lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.
