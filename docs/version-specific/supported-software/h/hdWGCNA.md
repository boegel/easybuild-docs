# hdWGCNA

hdWGCNA is an R package for performing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in high   dimensional transcriptomics data such as single-cell RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics. hdWGCNA is highly modular   and can construct context-specific co-expression networks across cellular and spatial hierarchies. hdWGNCA identifies   modules of highly co-expressed genes and provides context for these modules via statistical testing and biological   knowledge sources. hdWGCNA uses datasets formatted as Seurat objects.
