# OpenPGM

OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast  (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable  and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss, request  retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of unrecoverable loss.  PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible  for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception  responsibility.
