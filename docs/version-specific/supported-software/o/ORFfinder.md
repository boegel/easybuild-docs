# ORFfinder

ORF finder searches for open reading frames (ORFs) in the  DNA sequence you enter. The program returns the range of each ORF,  along with its protein translation. Use ORF finder to search newly  sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding segments, verify  predicted protein using newly developed SMART BLAST or regular BLASTP.
