# Octopus-vcf

Octopus is a mapping-based variant caller that implements several calling models within  a unified haplotype-aware framework. Octopus takes inspiration from particle filtering by constructing a  tree of haplotypes and dynamically pruning and extending the tree based on haplotype posterior probabilities  in a sequential manner. This allows octopus to implicitly consider all possible haplotypes at a given loci in  reasonable time.
