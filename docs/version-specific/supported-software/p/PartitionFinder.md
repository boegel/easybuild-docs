# PartitionFinder

PartitionFinder 2 is a Python program for simultaneously choosing partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for phylogenetic analyses of DNA, protein, and morphological data. You can PartitionFinder 2 before running a phylogenetic analysis, in order to decide how to divide up your sequence data into separate blocks before analysis, and to simultaneously perform model selection on each of those blocks.
