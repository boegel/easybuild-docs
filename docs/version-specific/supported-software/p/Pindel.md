# Pindel

Pindel can detect breakpoints of large deletions, medium sized   insertions, inversions, tandem duplications and other structural variants at single-based   resolution from next-gen sequence data. It uses a pattern growth approach to identify the   breakpoints of these variants from paired-end short reads.
