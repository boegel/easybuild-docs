# PSASS

PSASS (Pooled Sequencing Analysis for Sex Signal) is a software to compare pooled sequencing datasets from two groups (usually two sexes). Results from PSASS can be easily visualized using the sgtr R package. PSASS is integrated in a Snakemake workflow to perform all required steps starting from a genome and reads files.
