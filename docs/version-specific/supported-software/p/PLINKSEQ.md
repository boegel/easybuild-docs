# PLINKSEQ

PLINK/SEQ is an open-source C/C++ library for working with human   genetic variation data. The specific focus is to provide a platform for analytic tool   development for variation data from large-scale resequencing and genotyping projects,   particularly whole-exome and whole-genome studies. It is independent of (but designed   to be complementary to) the existing PLINK package.
