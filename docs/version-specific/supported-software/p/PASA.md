# PASA

PASA, acronym for Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (and pronounced 'pass-uh'),  is a eukaryotic genome annotation tool that exploits spliced alignments of expressed transcript  sequences to automatically model gene structures, and to maintain gene structure annotation consistent  with the most recently available experimental sequence data. PASA also identifies and classifies all  splicing variations supported by the transcript alignments.
