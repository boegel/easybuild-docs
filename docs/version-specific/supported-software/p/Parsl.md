# Parsl

Parsl extends parallelism in Python beyond a single computer. You can use Parsl just like Python's parallel executors but across multiple cores and nodes. However, the real power of Parsl is in expressing multi-step workflows of functions. Parsl lets you chain functions together and will launch each function as inputs and computing resources are available.
