# pbs_python

The pbs_python package is a wrapper class for the Torque C library. With this package you now can  write utilities/extensions in Python instead of C. We developed this package because we want to replace xpbsmon by  an ascii version named pbsmon. PBSQuery is also included in this package. This is a python module build on top of  the pbs python module to simplify querying the batch server, eg: how many jobs, how many nodes, ...
