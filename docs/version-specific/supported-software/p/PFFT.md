# PFFT

PFFT is a software library for computing massively parallel, fast Fourier transformations on distributed memory architectures. PFFT can be understood as a generalization of FFTW-MPI to multidimensional data decomposition. The library is written in C and MPI. A Fortran interface is also available. Support for hybrid parallelization based on OpenMP and MPI is under development.
