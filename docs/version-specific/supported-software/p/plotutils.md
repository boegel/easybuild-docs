# plotutils

The GNU plotutils package contains software for both programmers and  technical users. Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++ function library for  exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file formats, both vector and bitmap. On the  X Window System, it can also do 2-D vector graphics animations.  libplot is device-independent, in the sense that its API (application programming interface)  does not depend on the type of graphics file to be exported. A Postscript-like API  is used both for file export and for graphics animations. A libplot programmer needs  to learn only one API: not the details of many graphics file formats.
