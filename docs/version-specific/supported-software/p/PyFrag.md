# PyFrag

PyFrag 2019 resolves three main challenges associated with the automatized computational exploration of reaction mechanisms: 1) the management of multiple parallel calculations to automatically find a reaction path; 2) the monitoring of the entire computational process along with the extraction and plotting of relevant information from large amounts of data; and 3) the analysis and presentation of these data in a clear and informative way.  This module provides the Activation Strain Analysis (ASA) Module of PyFrag 2019
