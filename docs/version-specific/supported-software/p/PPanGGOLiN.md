# PPanGGOLiN

PPanGGOLiN is a software suite used to create and manipulate prokaryotic pangenomes from a set of either genomic DNA sequences or provided genome annotations. It is designed to scale up to tens of thousands of genomes. It has the specificity to partition the pangenome using a statistical approach rather than using fixed thresholds which gives it the ability to work with low-quality data such as Metagenomic Assembled Genomes (MAGs) or Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) thus taking advantage of large scale environmental studies and letting users study the pangenome of uncultivable species.
