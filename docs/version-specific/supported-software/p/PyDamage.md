# PyDamage

Pydamage, is a Python software to automate the process of contig damage identification and estimation. After modelling the ancient DNA damage using the C to T transitions, Pydamage uses a likelihood ratio test to discriminate between truly ancient, and modern contigs originating from sample contamination.
