# PRC

PRC is a stand-alone program for aligning and scoring two profile hidden Markov models.  This can be used to detect remote relationships between profiles more effectively than by doing simple  profile-sequence comparisons. PRC takes into account all transition and emission probabilities in both  hidden Markov models.
