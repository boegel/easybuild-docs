# pyseer

pyseer was first written a python reimplementation of seer, which was written in C++. pyseer uses  linear models with fixed or mixed effects to estimate the effect of genetic variation in a bacterial population  on a phenotype of interest, while accounting for potentially very strong confounding population structure.  This allows for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be performed in clonal organisms  such as bacteria and viruses.
