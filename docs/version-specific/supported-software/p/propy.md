# propy

Propy is a protein description software. It allows analyzing sequence-derived structural and physicochemical features, which are very useful in representing and distinguishing proteins or peptides of different structural, functional and interaction properties. These have been widely used in developing methods and software for predicting protein structural and functional classes, protein-protein interactions, drug-target interactions, protein substrates, among others.
