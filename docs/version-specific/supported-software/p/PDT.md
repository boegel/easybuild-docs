# PDT

Program Database Toolkit (PDT) is a framework for analyzing source  code written in several programming languages and for making rich program knowledge  accessible to developers of static and dynamic analysis tools. PDT implements a standard  program representation, the program database (PDB), that can be accessed in a uniform way  through a class library supporting common PDB operations.
