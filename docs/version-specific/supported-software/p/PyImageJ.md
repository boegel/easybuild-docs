# PyImageJ

PyImageJ provides a set of wrapper functions for integration between ImageJ2 and Python. It also  supports the original ImageJ API and data structures. A major advantage of this approach is the ability to combine  ImageJ and ImageJ2 with other tools available from the Python software ecosystem, including NumPy, SciPy,  scikit-image, CellProfiler, OpenCV, ITK and many more.
