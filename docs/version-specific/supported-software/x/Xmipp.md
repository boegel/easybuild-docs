Scipion is an image processing framework to obtain 3D models of macromolecular complexes using Electron Microscopy (3DEM). It integrates several software packages and presents an unified interface for both biologists and developers. Scipion allows to execute workflows combining different software tools, while taking care of formats and conversions. Additionally, all steps are tracked and can be reproduced later on.
