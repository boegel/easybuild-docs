# XKeyboardConfig

The non-arch keyboard configuration database for X Window.  The goal is to provide the consistent, well-structured,  frequently released open source of X keyboard configuration data  for X Window System implementations (free, open source and commercial).  The project is targeted to XKB-based systems.
