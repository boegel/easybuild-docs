# XALT

XALT 2 is a tool to allow a site to track user executables   and library usage on a cluster. When installed it can tell a site what are   the top executables by Node-Hours or by the number of users or the number   of times it is run. XALT 2 also tracks library usage as well. XALT 2 can   also track package use by R, MATLAB or Python. It tracks both MPI and   non-MPI programs.
