# qtop

qtop is a nifty command-line tool for monitoring queueing systems, esp. PBS/torque.  It tries to fit as much information as possible in your screen's real estate,  by stitching together the output of commands like pbsnodes -a, qstat & qstat -q.  It is possible to write wrappers for other platforms -people have done so for SGE, OAR etc-  or, even examine traces offline and present the sampled information.
