# FHI-aims

FHI-aims is an efficient, accurate all-electron, full-potential electronic structure code package for computational molecular and materials science (non-periodic and periodic systems). The code supports DFT (semilocal and hybrid) and many-body perturbation theory. FHI-aims is particularly efficient for molecular systems and nanostructures, while maintaining high numerical accuracy for all production tasks. Production calculations handle up to several thousand atoms and can efficiently use (ten) thousands of cores.
