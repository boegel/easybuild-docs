Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) is probably best known for its applications  in condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry. fullrmc which stands for  FUndamental Library Language for Reverse Monte Carlo is different than traditional  RMC but a stochastic modelling method to solve an inverse problem whereby  an atomic/molecular model is adjusted until its atoms position havei  the greatest consistency with a set of experimental data.
