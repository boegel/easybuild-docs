# Faber

Faber started as a clone of Boost.Build, to experiment with a  new Python frontend. Meanwhile it has evolved into a new build system, which  retains most of the features found in Boost.Build, but with (hopefully !) much  simplified logic, in addition of course to using Python as scripting language,  rather than Jam. The original bjam engine is still in use as scheduler, though  at this point that is mostly an implementation detail.
