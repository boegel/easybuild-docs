# FIt-SNE

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for  visualizing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, but it scales poorly to large  datasets. We dramatically accelerate t-SNE, obviating the need for data downsampling, and  hence allowing visualization of rare cell populations. Furthermore, we implement a  heatmap-style visualization for scRNA-seq based on one-dimensional t-SNE for simultaneously  visualizing the expression patterns of thousands of genes.
