# GARLI

GARLI, Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference is a   program for inferring phylogenetic trees. Using an approach similar to a   classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of evolutionary   trees and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood   score. It implements nucleotide, amino acid and codon-based models of sequence   evolution, and runs on all platforms.
