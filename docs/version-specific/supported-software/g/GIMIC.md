# GIMIC

The GIMIC program calculates magnetically induced currents in molecules.  You need to provide this program with a density matrix in atomic-orbital (AO) basis  and three (effective) magnetically perturbed AO density matrices in the proper format. Currently ACES2, Turbomole, G09, QChem, FERMION++, and LSDalton can produce these matrices.
