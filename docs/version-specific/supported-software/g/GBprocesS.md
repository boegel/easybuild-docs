# GBprocesS

GBprocesS allows for the extraction of genomic inserts from NGS data for GBS experiments. Preprocessing is performed in different stages that are part of a linear pipeline where the steps are performed in order. GBprocesS provides a flexible way to adjust the functionality to your needs, as the operations required and the execution order vary depending on the GBS protocol used.
