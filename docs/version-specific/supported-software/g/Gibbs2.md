# Gibbs2

Gibbs2 is a program for the calculation of thermodynamic properties in periodic solids under arbitrary  conditions of temperature and pressure. Gibbs2 uses the results of periodic solid-state quantum-mechanical  calculations, specifically the energy-volume curve and possibly the harmonic phonon frequencies, to compute the  thermodynamic properties of the solid within the framework of the quasiharmonic approximation.
