# GMT

GMT is an open source collection of about 80 command-line tools for manipulating  geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting,  etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps  to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views; the GMT supplements add another  40 more specialized and discipline-specific tools.
