# GEM

GEM (Gene-Environment interaction analysis for Millions of samples) is a  software program for large-scale gene-environment interaction testing in  samples from unrelated individuals. It enables genome-wide association  studies in up to millions of samples while allowing for multiple exposures,  control for genotype-covariate interactions, and robust inference.
