# gemmi

Gemmi is a library, accompanied by a set of programs, developed primarily for   use in macromolecular crystallography (MX). For working with:  macromolecular models (content of PDB, PDBx/mmCIF and mmJSON files), refinement restraints (CIF files), reflection data (MTZ and mmCIF formats), data on a 3D   grid (electron density maps, masks, MRC/CCP4 format) crystallographic symmetry. Parts of this library can be useful in structural bioinformatics (for symmetry- aware analysis of protein models), and in other molecular-structure sciences    that use CIF files (we have the fastest open-source CIF parser).
