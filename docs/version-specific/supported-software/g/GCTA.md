# GCTA

GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) is a software package, which was  initially developed to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained  by all genome-wide SNPs for a complex trait but has been extensively extended  for many other analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
