# GLM-AED

The General Lake Model (GLM) is a water balance and one-dimensional vertical stratification hydrodynamic model, which is dynamically coupled with the AED water quality modelling library. GLM-AED is suitable for simulating conditions in a wide range of natural and engineered lakes, including shallow (well-mixed) and deep (stratified) systems. The model has been successfully applied to systems from the scale of individual ponds and wetlands, to actively operated reservoirs, upto the scale of the Great Lakes.
