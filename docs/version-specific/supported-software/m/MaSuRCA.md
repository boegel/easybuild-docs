# MaSuRCA

MaSuRCA is whole genome assembly software. It combines the efficiency of the de Bruijn graph    and Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approaches. MaSuRCA can assemble data sets containing   only short reads from Illumina sequencing or a mixture of short reads and long reads   (Sanger, 454, Pacbio and Nanopore).
