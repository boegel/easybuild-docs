# manta

Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and  somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and  scores large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a  single efficient workflow.
