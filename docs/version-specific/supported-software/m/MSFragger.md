# MSFragger

MSFragger is an ultrafast database search tool for peptide identification  in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. It has demonstrated excellent performance across a wide  range of datasets and applications. MSFragger is suitable for standard shotgun proteomics  analyses as well as large datasets (including timsTOF PASEF data), enzyme unconstrained  searches (e.g., peptidome), open database searches (e.g., precursor mass tolerance set  to hundreds of Daltons) for identification of modified peptides, and glycopeptide  identification (N-linked and O-linked).
