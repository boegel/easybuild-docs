# mhcflurry

MHCflurry implements class I peptide/MHC binding affinity  prediction. By default it supports 112 MHC alleles using ensembles of  allele-specific models. Pan-allele predictors supporting virtually any MHC  allele of known sequence are available for testing (see below). MHCflurry  runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4+ using the keras neural network library. It  exposes command-line and Python library interfaces.
