MedPy is a library and script collection for medical image processing in Python, providing basic  functionalities for reading, writing and manipulating large images of arbitrary dimensionality. Its main  contributions are n-dimensional versions of popular image filters, a collection of image feature extractors, ready  to be used with scikit-learn, and an exhaustive n-dimensional graph-cut package.
