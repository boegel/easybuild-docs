# MOFA2

MOFA is a factor analysis model that provides a general framework  for the integration of multi-omic data sets in an unsupervised fashion. Intuitively,  MOFA can be viewed as a versatile and statistically rigorous generalization of principal  component analysis to multi-omics data. Given several data matrices with measurements  of multiple -omics data types on the same or on overlapping sets of samples,  MOFA infers an interpretable low-dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors.  These learnt factors represent the driving sources of variation across data modalities,  thus facilitating the identification of cellular states or disease subgroups.
