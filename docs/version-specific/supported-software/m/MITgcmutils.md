# MITgcmutils

A numerical model designed for study of the atmosphere, ocean,  and climate, MITgcmâ€™s flexible non-hydrostatic formulation enables it to  efficiently simulate fluid phenomena over a wide range of scales; its adjoint  capabilities enable it to be applied to sensitivity questions and to parameter  and state estimation problems. By employing fluid equation isomorphisms, a  single dynamical kernel can be used to simulate flow of both the atmosphere  and ocean. The model is developed to perform efficiently on a wide variety of  computational platforms.
