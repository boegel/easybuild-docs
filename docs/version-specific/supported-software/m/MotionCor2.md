# MotionCor2

MotionCor2 correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting.  Cite publication: Shawn Q.
