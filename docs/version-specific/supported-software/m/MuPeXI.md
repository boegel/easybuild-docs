# MuPeXI

MuPeXI: Mutant Peptide eXtractor and Informer. Given a list of somatic mutations (VCF file) as input,  MuPeXI returns a table containing all mutated peptides (neo-peptides) of user-defined lengths,  along with several pieces of information relevant for identifying  which of these neo-peptides are likely to serve as neo-epitopes.
