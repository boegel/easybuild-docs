# M3GNet

" M3GNet is a new materials graph neural network architecture that incorporates 3-body interactions. A key difference with prior materials graph implementations such as MEGNet is the addition of the coordinates for atoms and the 3Ã—3 lattice matrix in crystals, which are necessary for obtaining tensorial quantities such as forces and stresses via auto-differentiation.
