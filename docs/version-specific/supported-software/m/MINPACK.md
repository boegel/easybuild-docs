# MINPACK

Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and  nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include  a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed  either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or  directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for  systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares  problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency  of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
