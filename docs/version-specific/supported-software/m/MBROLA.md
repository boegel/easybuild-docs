# MBROLA

MBROLA is a speech synthesizer based on the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input, together with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear), at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.  MBROLA voices project provides list of MBROLA speech synthesizer voices. It is intended to provide easier collaboration and automatic updates for individual users and packagers.
