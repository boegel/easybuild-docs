# MPC

Gnu Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of  complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and correct  rounding of the result. It extends the principles of the IEEE-754  standard for fixed precision real floating point numbers to  complex numbers, providing well-defined semantics for every  operation. At the same time, speed of operation at high precision  is a major design goal.
