# MetaPhlAn2

MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial  communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from metagenomic shotgun sequencing  data (i.e. not 16S) with species-level. With the newly added StrainPhlAn module, it is now  possible to perform accurate strain-level microbial profiling.
