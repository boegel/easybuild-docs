# LIBSVM-Python

This tool provides a simple Python interface to LIBSVM, a library for support    vector machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). The interface is     very easy to use as the usage is the same as that of LIBSVM. The interface is    developed with the built-in Python library "ctypes".
