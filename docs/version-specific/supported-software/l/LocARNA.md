# LocARNA

LocARNA is a collection of alignment tools for the structural analysis of RNA.  Given a set of RNA sequences, LocARNA simultaneously aligns and predicts common structures for  your RNAs. In this way, LocARNA performs Sankoff-like alignment and is in particular suited for  analyzing sets of related RNAs without known common structure.
