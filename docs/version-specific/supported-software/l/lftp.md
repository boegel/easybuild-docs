# lftp

LFTP is a sophisticated ftp/http client, and a file transfer program supporting   a number of network protocols. Like BASH, it has job control and uses the readline library for   input. It has bookmarks, a built-in mirror command, and can transfer several files in parallel.   It was designed with reliability in mind.
