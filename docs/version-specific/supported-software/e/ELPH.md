# ELPH

ELPH is a general-purpose Gibbs sampler for finding motifs in a set   of DNA or protein sequences. The program takes as input a set containing anywhere from   a few dozen to thousands of sequences, and searches through them for the most common motif,   assuming that each sequence contains one copy of the motif. We have used ELPH to find   patterns such as ribosome binding sites (RBSs) and exon splicing enhancers (ESEs).
