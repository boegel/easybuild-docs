# EDirect

Entrez Direct (EDirect) provides access to the NCBI's suite of interconnected databases from a Unix terminal window. Search terms are entered as command-line arguments. Individual operations are connected with Unix pipes to construct multi-step queries. Selected records can then be retrieved in a variety of formats.
