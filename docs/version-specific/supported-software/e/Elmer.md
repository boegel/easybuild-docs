Elmer is an open source multiphysical simulation software mainly developed by  CSC - IT Center for Science (CSC). Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural  mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are described by  partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the Finite Element Method (FEM).
