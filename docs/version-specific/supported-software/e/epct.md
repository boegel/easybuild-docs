# epct

This is the epct (EUMETSAT Product Customisation Toolbox) Python package for the EUMETSAT Data Tailor. The EUMETSAT Data Tailor makes it possible for users to subset and aggregate EUMETSAT data products in space and time, filter layers, generate quicklooks, project onto new coordinate reference systems, and reformat into common GIS formats (netCDF, GeoTIFF, etc.).
