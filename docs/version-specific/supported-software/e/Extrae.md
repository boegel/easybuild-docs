# Extrae

Extrae is the core instrumentation package developed by the Performance Tools group at BSC. Extrae is capable of instrumenting applications based on MPI, OpenMP, pthreads, CUDA1, OpenCL1, and StarSs1 using different instrumentation approaches. The information gathered by Extrae typically includes timestamped events of runtime calls, performance counters and source code references. Besides, Extrae provides its own API to allow the user to manually instrument his or her application.
