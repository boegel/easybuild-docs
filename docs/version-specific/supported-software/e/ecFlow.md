# ecFlow

ecFlow is a client/server workflow package that enables users  to run a large number of programs (with dependencies on each other and on time)  in a controlled environment. It provides reasonable tolerance for hardware and  software failures, combined with restart capabilities.  It is used at ECMWF to run all our operational suites across a range of platforms.
