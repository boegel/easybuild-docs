# enchant-2

Enchant aims to provide a simple but comprehensive abstraction for dealing with different spell checking libraries in a consistent way. A client, such as a text editor or word processor, need not know anything about a specific spell-checker, and since all back-ends are plugins, new spell-checkers can be added without needing any change to the program using Enchant.
