# IsoNet

IsoNet stands for for ISOtropic reconstructioN of Electron Tomography. It trains deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct meaningful contents in the mis sing wedge for electron tomography, and to increase signal-to-noise ratio,       using the information learned from the original tomogram. The software requires  tomograms as input. Observing at about 30A resolution, the IsoNet generated      tomograms are largely isotropic.
