# ioapi

The Models-3/EDSS Input/Output Applications Programming Interface (I/O API) provides the  environmental model developer with an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use programming library for data storage and  access, available from both Fortran and C. The same routines can be used for both file storage (using netCDF  files) and model coupling (using PVM mailboxes). It is the standard data access library for both the  NCSC/CMAS's EDSS project and EPA's Models-3, CMAQ, and SMOKE, as well as various other atmospheric and  hydrological modeling systems.
