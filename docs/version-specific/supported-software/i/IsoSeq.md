# IsoSeq

IsoSeq v3 contains the newest tools to identify transcripts  in PacBio single-molecule sequencing data. Starting in SMRT  Link v6.0.0, those tools power the IsoSeq GUI-based analysis  application. A composable workflow of existing tools and  algorithms, combined with a new clustering technique, allows  to process the ever-increasing yield of PacBio machines with  similar performance to IsoSeq versions 1 and 2. Starting with  version 3.4, support for UMI and cell barcode based  deduplication has been added.
