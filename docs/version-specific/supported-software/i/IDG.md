# IDG

Image Domain Gridding (IDG) is a fast method for convolutional resampling (gridding/degridding) of radio astronomical data (visibilities). Direction dependent effects (DDEs) or A-tems can be applied in the gridding process. The algorithm is described in "Image Domain Gridding: a fast method for convolutional resampling of visibilities", Van der Tol (2018). The implementation is described in "Radio-astronomical imaging on graphics processors", Veenboer (2020). Please cite these papers in publications using IDG.
