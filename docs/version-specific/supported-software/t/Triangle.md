# Triangle

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations,  conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality triangular meshes.  The latter can be generated with no small or large angles,  and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.
