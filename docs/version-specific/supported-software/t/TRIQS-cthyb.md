# TRIQS-cthyb

TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) is a  scientific project providing a set of C++ and Python libraries to  develop new tools for the study of interacting quantum systems.   cthyb = continuous-time hybridisation-expansion quantum Monte Carlo   The TRIQS-based hybridization-expansion solver allows to solve the  generic problem of a quantum impurity embedded in a conduction bath  for an arbitrary local interaction vertex. The “impurity” can be any  set of orbitals, on one or several atoms.
