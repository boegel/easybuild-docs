# texlive

TeX is a typesetting language. Instead of visually formatting your text, you enter your manuscript  text intertwined with TeX commands in a plain text file. You then run TeX to produce formatted output, such as a  PDF file. Thus, in contrast to standard word processors, your document is a separate file that does not pretend to  be a representation of the final typeset output, and so can be easily edited and manipulated.
