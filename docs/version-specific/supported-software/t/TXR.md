# TXR

TXR is a pragmatic, convenient tool ready to take on your daily hacking challenges with its dual  personality: its whole-document pattern matching and extraction language for scraping information from arbitrary text  sources, and its powerful data-processing language to slice through problems like a hot knife through butter. Many  tasks can be accomplished with TXR "one liners" directly from your system prompt.
