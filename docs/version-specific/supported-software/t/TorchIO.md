# TorchIO

TorchIO is an open-source Python library for efficient loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of 3D medical images in deep learning, following the design of PyTorch.  It includes multiple intensity and spatial transforms for data augmentation and preprocessing. These transforms include typical computer vision operations such as random affine transformations and also domain-specific ones such as simulation of intensity artifacts due to MRI magnetic field inhomogeneity (bias) or k-space motion artifacts.
