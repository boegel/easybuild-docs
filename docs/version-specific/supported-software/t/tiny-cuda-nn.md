# tiny-cuda-nn

is a small, self-contained framework for training and querying neural networks. Most notably, it contains a lightning fast "fully fused" multi-layer perceptron (technical paper), a versatile multiresolution hash encoding (technical paper), as well as support for various other input encodings, losses, and optimizers.
