# TRUST4

Tcr Receptor Utilities for Solid Tissue (TRUST) is a computational tool to  analyze TCR and BCR sequences using unselected RNA sequencing data, profiled  from solid tissues, including tumors. TRUST4 performs de novo assembly on V, J,  C genes including the hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)  and reports consensus of BCR/TCR sequences.
