# TRIQS-tprf

TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) is a  scientific project providing a set of C++ and Python libraries to  develop new tools for the study of interacting quantum systems.   TPRF is a TRIQS-based two-particle response function tool box that  implements basic operations for higher order response functions such  as inversion, products, the random phase approximation, the bethe  salpeter equation (in the local vertex approximation), etc..   The aim is to provide efficient (C++/OpenMP/MPI) implementations of  the basic operations needed to compute the two-particle response in  the different two-particle channels (particle-hole, particle-particle).
