# TCC

The Tiny C Compiler (aka TCC, tCc, or TinyCC) is an x86 and x86-64 C compiler  created by Fabrice Bellard. It is designed to work for slow computers with little disk space  and can run shebang style !/usr/bin/tcc . TCC is distributed under the LGPL. TCC claims to  implement all of ANSI C (C89/C90),[1] much of the new ISO C99 standard,  and many GNU C extensions including inline assembly.
