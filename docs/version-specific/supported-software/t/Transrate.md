# Transrate

Transrate is software for de-novo transcriptome assembly quality analysis.  It examines your assembly in detail and compares it to experimental evidence  such as the sequencing reads, reporting quality scores for contigs and  assemblies. This allows you to choose between assemblers and parameters,  filter out the bad contigs from an assembly, and help decide when  to stop trying to improve the assembly.
