# tseriesEntropy

Implements an Entropy measure of dependence based on the Bhattacharya-Hellinger-Matusita distance.  Can be used as a (nonlinear) autocorrelation/crosscorrelation function for continuous and categorical time series.  The package includes tests for serial dependence and nonlinearity based on it.  Some routines have a parallel version that can be used in a multicore/cluster environment.  The package makes use of S4 classes.
