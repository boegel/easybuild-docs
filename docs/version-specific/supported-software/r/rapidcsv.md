# rapidcsv

Rapidcsv is a C++ header-only library for CSV parsing.  While the name admittedly was inspired by the rapidjson project,  the objectives are not the same. The goal of rapidcsv is to be  an easy-to-use CSV library enabling rapid development.  For optimal performance (be it CPU or memory usage) a CSV parser  implemented for the specific use-case is likely to be more performant.
