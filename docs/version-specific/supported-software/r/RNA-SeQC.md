# RNA-SeQC

RNA-SeQC is a java program which computes a series of quality control metrics for  RNA-seq data. The input can be one or more BAM files. The output consists of HTML reports and tab  delimited files of metrics data. This program can be valuable for comparing sequencing quality  across different samples or experiments to evaluate different experimental parameters. It can  also be run on individual samples as a means of quality control before continuing with downstream  analysis.
