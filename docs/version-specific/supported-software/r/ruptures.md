# ruptures

ruptures is a Python library for off-line change point detection. This package provides  methods for the analysis and segmentation of non-stationary signals. Implemented  algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various parametric and  non-parametric models. ruptures focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and  consistent interface. In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different algorithms  and models can be connected and extended within this package.
