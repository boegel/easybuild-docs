# NVSHMEM

NVSHMEM is a parallel programming interface based on OpenSHMEM that provides  efficient and scalable communication for NVIDIA GPU clusters. NVSHMEM creates a  global address space for data that spans the memory of multiple GPUs and can be  accessed with fine-grained GPU-initiated operations, CPU-initiated operations,  and operations on CUDA streams.
