# novaSTA

C++ version of subtomogram averaging (SA) scripts from TOM/AV3 package           https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0409178102. Both CPU and GPU parallelization is     supported although the latter performs significantly worse in terms of           processing time (the code is not well optimized) and is thus not recommended for larger datasets.
