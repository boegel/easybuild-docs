Noise2Void - Learning Denoising from Single Noisy Images The field of image denoising is currently dominated by discriminative deep       learning methods that are trained on pairs of noisy input and clean target       images. Recently it has been shown that such methods can also be trained without clean targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used, in an     approach known as NOISE2NOISE (N2N). Here, we introduce NOISE2VOID (N2V), a      training scheme that takes this idea one step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train       directly on the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied when    other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the application to biomedical    image data, where the acquisition of training targets, clean or noisy, is        frequently not possible. We compare the performance of N2V to approaches that    have either clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available. Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that have more information          available during training. Still, we observe that the denoising performance of   NOISE2VOID drops in moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising methods.
