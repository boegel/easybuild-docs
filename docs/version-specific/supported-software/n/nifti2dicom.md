# nifti2dicom

Nifti2Dicom is a conversion tool that converts 3D NIfTI files (and other formats supported by ITK, including Analyze, MetaImage Nrrd and VTK) to DICOM. Unlike other conversion tools, it can import a DICOM file that is used to import the patient and study DICOM tags, and allows you to edit the accession number and other DICOM tags, in order to create a valid DICOM that can be imported in a PACS.
