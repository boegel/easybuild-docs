# numdiff

Numdiff (which I will also write numdiff) is a little program that can be used to compare putatively  similar files line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric differences or/and different numeric formats.  Equivalently, Numdiff is a program with the capability to appropriately compare files containing numerical fields  (and not only).
