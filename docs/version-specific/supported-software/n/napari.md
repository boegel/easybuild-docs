# napari

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's   designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based           rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).
