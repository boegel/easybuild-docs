# JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar  building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs,  etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter  Notebook.
