# DeltaLake

Native Delta Lake Python binding based on delta-rs with Pandas integration. The Delta Lake project aims to unlock the power of the Deltalake for as many users and projects as possible by providing native low-level APIs aimed at developers and integrators, as well as a high-level operations API that lets you query, inspect, and operate your Delta Lake with ease.
