# dagitty

A port of the web-based software 'DAGitty', available at <http://dagitty.net>, for  analyzing structural causal models (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs). This package  computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, enumerates instrumental variables,  derives testable implications (d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent models, and  includes a simple facility for data simulation.
