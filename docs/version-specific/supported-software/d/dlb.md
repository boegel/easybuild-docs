# dlb

DLB is a dynamic library designed to speed up HPC hybrid applications (i.e., two levels of parallelism) by improving the load balance of the outer level of parallelism (e.g., MPI) by dynamically redistributing the computational resources at the inner level of parallelism (e.g., OpenMP). at run time.
