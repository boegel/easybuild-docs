# DaliLite

DaliLite is a light version of the software run by the Dali server. The web server has search and data visualization options which are not included in this package. DaliLite supports data import (import.pl) to convert PDB entries to Dali's internal data format and pairwise comparison (dali.pl) to structurally align a list of query structures to a list of target structures.
