# DEICODE

DEICODE is a form of Aitchison Distance that is robust to high levels of sparsity. DEICODE utilizes a natural solution to the zero problem formulated in recommendation systems called matrix completion. A simple way to interpret the method is, as a robust compositional PCA (via SVD) where zero values do not influence the resulting ordination.
