# Devito

Devito is a domain-specific Language (DSL) and code generation framework for  performing optimised Finite Difference (FD) computation from high-level symbolic problem definitions.  Devito performs automated code generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic  equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly optimised Finite Difference stencil kernels on  multiple computer platforms.
