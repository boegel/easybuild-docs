# DETONATE

DETONATE (DE novo TranscriptOme rNa-seq Assembly with or without the Truth Evaluation)  consists of two component packages, RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL. Both packages are mainly intended to be used  to evaluate de novo transcriptome assemblies, although REF-EVAL can be used to compare sets of any kinds  of genomic sequences.
