# dune-fem

DUNE-FEM is a discretization module based on DUNE containing all the building blocks required to implement efficient solvers for a wide range of (systems of non linear) partial differential equations. DUNE-FEM can also be used through an extensive Python interface which brings all components of DUNE-FEM and the DUNE core modules to Python.
