# SNPomatic

High throughput sequencing technologies generate large amounts of short reads.  Mapping these to a reference sequence consumes large amounts of processing  time and memory, and read mapping errors can lead to noisy or incorrect  alignments. SNP-o-matic is a fast, memory-efficient, and stringent read  mapping tool offering a variety of analytical output functions, with an  emphasis on genotyping.
