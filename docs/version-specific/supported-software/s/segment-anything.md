# segment-anything

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from input prompts  such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image.  It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot  performance on a variety of segmentation tasks.
