# SpatialDE

SpatialDE is a method to identify genes which significantly depend on spatial coordinates in  non-linear and non-parametric ways. The intended applications are spatially resolved RNA-sequencing from e.g.  Spatial Transcriptomics, or in situ gene expression measurements from e.g. SeqFISH or MERFISH.
