The Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) is a common architecture for all Sentinel Toolboxes being jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, SkyWatch and C-S. The SNAP architecture is ideal for Earth Observation processing and analysis due to the following technological innovations: Extensibility, Portability, Modular Rich Client Platform, Generic EO Data Abstraction, Tiled Memory Management, and a Graph Processing Framework.
