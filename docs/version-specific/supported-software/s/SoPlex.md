# SoPlex

SoPlex is an optimization package for solving linear programming problems (LPs) based on an advanced implementation of the primal and dual revised simplex algorithm. It provides special support for the exact solution of LPs with rational input data. It can be used as a standalone solver reading MPS or LP format files via a command line interface as well as embedded into other programs via a C++ class library.
