# Shasta

The goal of the Shasta long read assembler is to rapidly produce accurate assembled sequence using DNA reads generated by Oxford Nanopore flow cells as input. Computational methods used by the Shasta assembler include: Using a run-length representation of the read sequence. This makes the assembly process more resilient to errors in homopolymer repeat counts, which are the most common type of errors in Oxford Nanopore reads. Using in some phases of the computation a representation of the read sequence based on markers, a fixed subset of short k-mers (k â‰ˆ 10).
