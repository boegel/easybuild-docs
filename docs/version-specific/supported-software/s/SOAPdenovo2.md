# SOAPdenovo2

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a   de novo draft assembly for human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to   assemble Illumina short reads. It creates new opportunities for building reference   sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.   SOAPdenovo2 is the successor of SOAPdenovo.
