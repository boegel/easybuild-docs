# sonic

Sonic is a simple algorithm for speeding up or slowing down speech.  However, it's optimized for speed ups of over 2X, unlike previous algorithms for changing speech rate.  The Sonic library is a very simple ANSI C library that is designed to easily be integrated into streaming voice applications, like TTS back ends.
