# SCALCE

SCALCE [skeÉªlz] is a FASTQ compression tool that uses locally consistet parsing  to obtain better compression rate. SCALCE has been specifically designed for Illumina reads but it can  handle other technologies (that generate base pair reads) if the read length is the same throughout the file.
