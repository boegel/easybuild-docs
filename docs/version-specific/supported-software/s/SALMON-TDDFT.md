# SALMON-TDDFT

SALMON is an open-source computer program for ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations of  electron dynamics at the nanoscale that takes place in various situations of light-matter interactions.  It is based on time-dependent density functional theory, solving time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation in  real time and real space with norm-conserving pseudopotentials.
