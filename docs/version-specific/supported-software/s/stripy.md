# stripy

A Python interface to TRIPACK and STRIPACK Fortran code for (constrained) triangulation in Cartesian  coordinates and on a sphere. Stripy is an object-oriented package and includes routines from SRFPACK and SSRFPACK for  interpolation (nearest neighbor, linear and hermite cubic) and to evaluate derivatives (Renka 1996a,b and 1997a,b).
