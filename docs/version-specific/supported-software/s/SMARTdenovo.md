# SMARTdenovo

SMARTdenovo is a de novo assembler for PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) data. It produces an assembly from all-vs-all raw read alignments without an error correction stage. It also provides tools to generate accurate consensus sequences, though a platform dependent consensus polish tools (e.g. Quiver for PacBio or Nanopolish for ONT) are still required for higher accuracy.
