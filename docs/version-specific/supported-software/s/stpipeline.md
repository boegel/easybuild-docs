# stpipeline

The ST Pipeline contains the tools and scripts needed to process  and analyze the raw files generated with the Spatial Transcriptomics method  in FASTQ format to generated datasets for down-stream analysis. The ST  pipeline can also be used to process single cell data as long as a file  with barcodes identifying each cell is provided. The ST Pipeline can also  process RNA-Seq datasets generated with or without UMIs.
