# SSAHA2

SSAHA2 (Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm) is a   pairwise sequence alignment program designed for the efficient mapping of sequencing   reads onto genomic reference sequences. SSAHA2 reads of most sequencing platforms   (ABI-Sanger, Roche 454, Illumina-Solexa) and a range of output formats (SAM, CIGAR, PSL etc.)   are supported. A pile-up pipeline for analysis and genotype calling is available as   a separate package.
