# SPM

SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) refers to the construction  and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypo-  theses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in  software that is called SPM.  The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging  data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts,  or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the  analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.
