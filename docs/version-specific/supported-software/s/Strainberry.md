# Strainberry

Strainberry is a method that performs strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using error-prone long-read technologies. It exploits state-of-the-art tools for variant calling, haplotype phasing, and genome assembly, in order to achieve single-sample assembly of strains with higher quality than other state-of-the-art long-read assemblers.
