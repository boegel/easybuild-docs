# Stacks

Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences, such as those generated on  the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq,  for the purpose of building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.
