# starparser

Use this package to manipulate Relion star files, including counting, modifying, plotting, and sifting the data. At the very least, this is a useful alternative  to awk commands, which can get awkward. Below is a description of the command-   line options with some examples. Alternatively, use starparser within Relion or  load the modules in your own Python scripts.
