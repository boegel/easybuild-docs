# sympy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to  become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as  simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy  is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
