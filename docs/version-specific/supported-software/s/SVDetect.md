# SVDetect

SVDetect is a application for the isolation and the type prediction of intra- and inter-chromosomal  rearrangements from paired-end/mate-pair sequencing data provided by the high-throughput sequencing technologies.  This tool aims to identifying structural variations with both clustering and sliding-window strategies, and  helping in their visualization at the genome scale.
