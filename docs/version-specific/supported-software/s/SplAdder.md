# SplAdder

Splicing Adder is a toolbox for alternative splicing analysis based on RNA-Seq alignment data. Briefly, the software takes a given annotation and RNA-Seq read alignments in standardized formats, transforms the annotation into a splicing graph representation, augments the splicing graph with additional information extracted from the read data, extracts alternative splicing events from the graph and quantifies the events based on the alignment data.
