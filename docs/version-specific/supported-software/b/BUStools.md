# BUStools

bustools is a program for manipulating BUS files for single cell RNA-Seq datasets.  It can be used to error correct barcodes, collapse  UMIs, produce gene count or transcript compatibility  count matrices, and is useful for many other tasks. See the kallisto | bustools  website for examples  and instructions on how to use bustools as part of a single-cell RNA-seq workflow.
