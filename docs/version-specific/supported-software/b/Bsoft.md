# Bsoft

Bsoft is a collection of programs and a platform for development of software  for image and molecular processing in structural biology. Problems in  structural biology are approached with a highly modular design, allowing fast  development of new algorithms without the burden of issues such as file I/O.  It provides an easily accessible interface, a resource that can be and has  been used in other packages.
