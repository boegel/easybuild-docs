# BLASR

BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement) rapidly maps   reads to genomes by finding the highest scoring local alignment or set of local alignments   between the read and the genome. Optimized for PacBio's extraordinarily long reads and   taking advantage of rich quality values, BLASR maps reads rapidly with high accuracy.
