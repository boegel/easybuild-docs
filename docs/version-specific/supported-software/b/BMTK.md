# BMTK

The Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK) is a python-based software package for building, simulating and analyzing large-scale neural network models. It supports the building and simulation of models of varying levels-of-resolution; from multi-compartment biophysically detailed networks, to point-neuron models, to filter-based models, and even population-level firing rate models.
