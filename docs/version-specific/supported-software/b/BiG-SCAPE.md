# BiG-SCAPE

BiG-SCAPE and CORASON provide a set of tools to explore the diversity of biosynthetic gene clusters  (BGCs) across large numbers of genomes, by constructing BGC sequence similarity networks, grouping BGCs into gene  cluster families, and exploring gene cluster diversity linked to enzyme phylogenies.
