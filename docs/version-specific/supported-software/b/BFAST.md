# BFAST

BFAST facilitates the fast and accurate mapping of short reads to reference sequences.  Some advantages of BFAST include:  1) Speed: enables billions of short reads to be mapped quickly.   2) Accuracy: A priori probabilities for mapping reads with defined set of variants.   3) An easy way to measurably tune accuracy at the expense of speed.
